Additionally, any variability in agricultural practices and their influence on emissions, such as fertilizer types and usage, are considered outside the scope of this assessment.\n\n2. Moisture Content: This study assumes that the moisture content of the corn is consistent with standard industry averages. Any fluctuations in moisture content at the time of harvesting or processing that may alter the energy required for drying or the emission levels are not explicitly modeled. The effect of moisture content variability on the final GHG intensity of the biofuel product is not considered, which may limit the accuracy of calculated emission reductions.\n\n3. Gasoline Consumption: The assessment assumes a standard rate of gasoline consumption within agricultural operations for corn production. Variations in gasoline consumption due to differences in machinery efficiency or specific farming practices are not evaluated. This assumption may lead to discrepancies in GHG calculations for operations where gasoline usage significantly deviates from assumed norms.\n\n4. Diesel CO2 Emission Factor: The study assumes a fixed CO2 emission factor for diesel, in line with ISCC EU and EU RED II guidelines. Any regional variations in diesel composition or combustion efficiency, which could result in differing CO2 emissions, are not accounted for in this analysis.

The analysis covers a period of 1 year, focusing on the production of organic corn. GHG emissions calculations are conducted according to the requirements of the ISCC EU framework.\n\n## Calculation Methodology\n\nThe GHG intensity calculations for corn used as a feedstock in the production of biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels are conducted according to the methodology outlined in ISCC EU 205 Version 4.1, released in January 2024.\n\nThe methodology involves calculating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn. This includes all emissions from cultivation, processing, and transportation. The life cycle assessment follows a clear and structured approach. Each stage of the corn supply chain is evaluated for its respective GHG emissions.\n\nEmissions from the cultivation stage include those from fertilizer application, field operations, and energy use on the farm. Processing emissions account for all energy and resources used in converting corn into biofuel. Transportation emissions include those generated by moving the corn and processed products to various locations.\n\nThe total GHG emissions from these stages are tallied to provide a comprehensive GHG intensity figure for the corn feedstock. This figure is then used to assess compliance with sustainability criteria. The methodology aims for accuracy and consistency in assessing GHG emissions, promoting transparency and environmental responsibility.\n\n## Allocation Approach\n\nIn accordance with the ISCC EU methodology and the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (EU RED II), the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions is conducted with precision to maintain transparency and accuracy in accounting. For the purposes of this study, it is assumed that the production of corn does not generate any co-products during the farming stage. Therefore, 100% of the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from both farming and transportation activities are attributed solely to corn as the main product. This allocation approach simplifies the emissions accounting process, ensuring that all emissions are fully accounted for the primary product, corn, in its pathway from cultivation to its subsequent use in biofuel production.\n\n## Scope of the Analysis\n\nThis analysis assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of corn used as a feedstock for biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels, following the ISCC EU framework and EU RED II guidelines. The GHG intensity is expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (g CO2e/MJ).\n\nThe system boundary encompasses the entire lifecycle of corn as used in the production of biofuels and related products. This includes all processes involved in corn farming, such as land preparation, planting, fertilization, irrigation, pest management, harvesting, and any other pertinent agricultural activities. Additionally, the analysis covers the transportation of all raw materials and inputs used in the corn farming process, such as fertilizers and seeds, as well as the transportation of the harvested corn to the end user or fuel producer.\n\nThe temporal coverage of this analysis is set at 1 year, providing a comprehensive review of the annual GHG emissions associated with corn production and supply. Geographically, the study is focused on the state of California, USA, capturing the region-specific agricultural practices and transportation logistics relevant to corn as a biofuel feedstock.\n\n## Activity Data Used\n\n### Table 1: Corn Production Data\n\n| Parameter           | Amount | Unit                    | Source                   | Notes           |\n|---------------------|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| Corn Production     | 12     | ton per hectare per year| Enter source of input data | AI reasoning     |\n| Moisture Content    | 15%    | %                       | Enter source of input data | Add any notes    |\n\n### Table 2: Liquid Fuels Consumption\n\n| Parameter           | Amount | Unit                    | Source                   | Notes           |\n|---------------------|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| Diesel Consumption  | 12     | liter per hectare per year | Enter source of input data | Add any notes    |\n\nThe data above provides the foundational activity data necessary for assessing the GHG intensity of corn production at Manish Corn Farm, located in California, USA, over a one-year analysis period. Corn production is quantified at 12 tons per hectare per year, with a moisture content of 15%. The moisture content is an essential variable as it can influence both the processing efficiency and the energy balance calculations for biofuels derived from the corn.\n\nIn regards to liquid fuel consumption, the farm utilizes 12 liters of diesel per hectare annually. This diesel usage is critical in calculating the direct GHG emissions associated with corn cultivation practices.

The analysis covers a period of 1 year, focusing on the production of organic corn. GHG emissions calculations are conducted according to the requirements of the ISCC EU framework.\n\n## Calculation Methodology\n\nThe GHG intensity calculations for corn used as a feedstock in the production of biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels are conducted according to the methodology outlined in ISCC EU 205 Version 4.1, released in January 2024.\n\nThe methodology involves calculating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn.

For the purposes of this study, it is assumed that the production of corn does not generate any co-products during the farming stage. Therefore, 100% of the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from both farming and transportation activities are attributed solely to corn as the main product. This allocation approach simplifies the emissions accounting process, ensuring that all emissions are fully accounted for the primary product, corn, in its pathway from cultivation to its subsequent use in biofuel production.\n\n## Scope of the Analysis\n\nThis analysis assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of corn used as a feedstock for biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels, following the ISCC EU framework and EU RED II guidelines. The GHG intensity is expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (g CO2e/MJ).\n\nThe system boundary encompasses the entire lifecycle of corn as used in the production of biofuels and related products. This includes all processes involved in corn farming, such as land preparation, planting, fertilization, irrigation, pest management, harvesting, and any other pertinent agricultural activities. Additionally, the analysis covers the transportation of all raw materials and inputs used in the corn farming process, such as fertilizers and seeds, as well as the transportation of the harvested corn to the end user or fuel producer.\n\nThe temporal coverage of this analysis is set at 1 year, providing a comprehensive review of the annual GHG emissions associated with corn production and supply.

The analysis covers a period of 1 year, focusing on the production of organic corn. GHG emissions calculations are conducted according to the requirements of the ISCC EU framework.', 'Allocation Approach': '### ALLOCATION APPROACH\n\nIn accordance with the ISCC EU methodology and the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (EU RED II), the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions is conducted with precision to maintain transparency and accuracy in accounting. For the purposes of this study, it is assumed that the production of corn does not generate any co-products during the farming stage. Therefore, 100% of the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from both farming and transportation activities are attributed solely to corn as the main product. This allocation approach simplifies the emissions accounting process, ensuring that all emissions are fully accounted for the primary product, corn, in its pathway from cultivation to its subsequent use in biofuel production.', 'Scope of the Analysis': '**SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS**\n\nThis analysis assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of corn used as a feedstock for biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels, following the ISCC EU framework and EU RED II guidelines. The GHG intensity is expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (g CO2e/MJ).\n\nThe system boundary encompasses the entire lifecycle of corn as used in the production of biofuels and related products. This includes all processes involved in corn farming, such as land preparation, planting, fertilization, irrigation, pest management, harvesting, and any other pertinent agricultural activities. Additionally, the analysis covers the transportation of all raw materials and inputs used in the corn farming process, such as fertilizers and seeds, as well as the transportation of the harvested corn to the end user or fuel producer.\n\nThe temporal coverage of this analysis is set at 1 year, providing a comprehensive review of the annual GHG emissions associated with corn production and supply. Geographically, the study is focused on the state of California, USA, capturing the region-specific agricultural practices and transportation logistics relevant to corn as a biofuel feedstock.', 'References': '**REFERENCE**\n\n1.

Standard Data and Assumptions for GHG Emission Factors. The ISCC EU framework utilizes standard emission factors for various fuels in GHG calculations, essential for assessing the GHG intensity of different feedstocks:\n   - Diesel GHG emission factor.\n   - Gasoline GHG emission factor.\n   - Natural Gas GHG emission factor.\n\nAll referenced standards and guidelines align with the objectives of the ISCC EU certification framework and EU RED II, ensuring the consistency and reliability of GHG emissions assessments for biofuel production.', 'Calculation Methodology': 'CALCULATION METHODOLOGY\n\nThe GHG intensity calculations for corn used as a feedstock in the production of biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels are conducted according to the methodology outlined in ISCC EU 205 Version 4.1, released in January 2024.\n\nThe methodology involves calculating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn. This includes all emissions from cultivation, processing, and transportation. The life cycle assessment follows a clear and structured approach. Each stage of the corn supply chain is evaluated for its respective GHG emissions. \n\nEmissions from the cultivation stage include those from fertilizer application, field operations, and energy use on the farm. Processing emissions account for all energy and resources used in converting corn into biofuel. Transportation emissions include those generated by moving the corn and processed products to various locations.\n\nThe total GHG emissions from these stages are tallied to provide a comprehensive GHG intensity figure for the corn feedstock. This figure is then used to assess compliance with sustainability criteria. The methodology aims for accuracy and consistency in assessing GHG emissions, promoting transparency and environmental responsibility.', 'Results and Interpretation': 'RESULT\n\n### Table: GHG Intensity of Corn for Liquid Fuels\n\n| Fuel Type | CO2 Emissions | Unit       | CH4 Emissions | Unit      | N2O Emissions | Unit      | Total GHG Emissions | Unit      |\n|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Diesel    |               | unit_CO2   |               | unit_CH4  |               | unit_N2O  |                     | unit_GHG  |\n| Gasoline  |               | unit_CO2   |               | unit_CH4  |               | unit_N2O  |                     | unit_GHG  |\n\n### Chart: GHG Emissions from Corn-based Liquid Fuels\n\nUnfortunately, a graphical representation of the data cannot be generated as no numerical values are provided.

The emissions data are categorized into CO2, CH4, and N2O for each fuel type, reflecting the impact of utilizing corn-derived biofuels in terms of different greenhouse gases. While specific values for each type of emission unit are not supplied within the current dataset, the framework is set up for a comprehensive comparison.\n\nOnce the numerical values are added, this overview will enable an analysis of which fuel type produces fewer greenhouse gases, helping in decision-making processes focused on reducing carbon footprints.

Corn production is quantified at 12 tons per hectare per year, with a moisture content of 15%. The moisture content is an essential variable as it can influence both the processing efficiency and the energy balance calculations for biofuels derived from the corn.\n\nIn regards to liquid fuel consumption, the farm utilizes 12 liters of diesel per hectare annually. This diesel usage is critical in calculating the direct GHG emissions associated with corn cultivation practices. Together, these data points serve as key inputs for the subsequent GHG emissions accounting as per the ISCC EU methodology and EU RED II requirements.', 'Assumptions and Limitations': 'LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n1. Corn Products: It is assumed that the type of corn used in this study is representative of typical corn used as a feedstock for the production of biofuels, bioliquids, or biomass fuels. However, the study does not account for potential variations in corn yield or genetic differences that may impact overall GHG emissions. Additionally, any variability in agricultural practices and their influence on emissions, such as fertilizer types and usage, are considered outside the scope of this assessment.\n\n2. Moisture Content: This study assumes that the moisture content of the corn is consistent with standard industry averages. Any fluctuations in moisture content at the time of harvesting or processing that may alter the energy required for drying or the emission levels are not explicitly modeled. The effect of moisture content variability on the final GHG intensity of the biofuel product is not considered, which may limit the accuracy of calculated emission reductions.\n\n3. Gasoline Consumption: The assessment assumes a standard rate of gasoline consumption within agricultural operations for corn production. Variations in gasoline consumption due to differences in machinery efficiency or specific farming practices are not evaluated. This assumption may lead to discrepancies in GHG calculations for operations where gasoline usage significantly deviates from assumed norms.\n\n4. Diesel CO2 Emission Factor: The study assumes a fixed CO2 emission factor for diesel, in line with ISCC EU and EU RED II guidelines. Any regional variations in diesel composition or combustion efficiency, which could result in differing CO2 emissions, are not accounted for in this analysis. This presents a limitation as actual emissions may vary based on local diesel characteristics and the condition of agricultural machinery.\n\nThese assumptions and limitations are in accordance with ISCC EU framework and EU RED II regulation. They reflect an inherent simplification of real-world conditions to maintain consistency and comparability within the scope of certifying the sustainability and GHG performance of corn-based biofuels.', 'Standard Data Used': "# STANDARD DATA USED\n\n## Global Warming Potential\n\n| Description | CO2 | CH4 | N2O | Source | Notes, if any |\n|-------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|---------------|\n| This is a corn farm and we need to grow best organic corn | - | - | - | - | - |\n\n## Liquid Fuels GHG Emission Factor\n\n| Diesel | CO2 (KG) | unit_CO2 | CH4 (KG) | unit_CH4 | N2O (KG) | unit_N2O | Source | Notes, if any |\n|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|---------------|\n| Diesel | 24.45    | KG       | 0        | KG       | 0        | KG       | -      | -             |\n\n## Lower Heating Values\n\n| Diesel | Amount | Unit |\n|--------|--------|------|\n| Diesel | -      | -    |\n\n## Density\n\n| Diesel | Amount | Unit |\n|--------|--------|------|\n| Diesel | -      | -    |\n\n### Summary:\nThe data provided for the evaluation of the GHG emissions linked to corn cultivation and related processes within this corn farm are partial and primarily pertain to diesel used as a fuel.
